# What is React Three Fiber?

- React and Three.js, together
- Three.js is a 3D engine for the web
- React is a component-driven JS library for building UI

---

# Anatomy of a three.js application

- create scene
- setup lights
- add meshes to the scene
- initialize renderer
- add objects to the scene
- initialize resize event
- initialize render loop

---

# Hard things

- hard to interact with objects inside the canvas
- no onClick, onHover handlers on objects
- state management is up to you
- manual handling of render loop
- manual handling of window resize

---

# This is where React comes in

- Declarative language
- built-in state management (useState hook)
- built-in onClick handlers
- rendering is handled by React
- but React itself can only handle DOM elements

---

# R3F to the rescue

- React has a "Reconciler"
- allows React to handle things other than the DOM
- R3F creates the bridge between JSX and Three.js
- Think of Spheres, Lights, Cameras as React Components
- There can even be a storybook containing these components
